# Door signals and attributes
# The default VSS (i.e. this file) assumes a vehicle with two rows of doors
# with two doors in front row and two doors in second row.
# For real deployments this needs to be overridden with actual values
# Row1 is the frontmost row.
# Row2-RowX are subsequent rows of doors.
#
# Note that rear door (for hatchback and station wagons) shall typically not be represented
# as a door, but rather be represented as a trunk (Vehicle.Body.Trunk) and
# rear shade (Vehicle.Cabin.RearShade)

If this signal specifies that DriverPosition is LEFT or MIDDLE, then DriverSide refers to left side and PassengerSide to right side. If this signal specifies that DriverPosition is RIGHT, then DriverSide refers to right side and PassengerSide to left side.
