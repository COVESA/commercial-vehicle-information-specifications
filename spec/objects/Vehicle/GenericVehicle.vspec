LowVoltageSystemState:
  datatype: string
  type: sensor
  allowed: [
    'UNDEFINED', # State of low voltage system not known
    'LOCK',      # Low voltage system off, steering lock or equivalent engaged
    'OFF',       # Low voltage system off, steering lock or equivalent not engaged
    'ACC',       # Vehicle Accessories on/living
    'ON',        # Engine start enabled (e.g. ignition on, diesel pre-heating, electrical drive released)
    'START'      # Engine starter relay closed (not applicable for electrical vehicles)
    ]
  description: State of the supply voltage of the control units (usually 12V).

Speed:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: km/h
  description: Vehicle speed.

TraveledDistance:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: km
  description: Odometer reading, total distance traveled during the lifetime of the vehicle.

TraveledDistanceSinceStart:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: km
  description: Distance traveled since start of current trip.
  comment: A new trip is considered to start when engine gets enabled (e.g. LowVoltageSystemState in ON or START mode).
           A trip is considered to end when engine is no longer enabled.
           The signal may however keep the value of the last trip until a new trip is started.

StartTime:
  datatype: string
  type: attribute
  default: '0000-01-01T00:00Z'
  unit: iso8601
  description: Start time of current or latest trip, formatted according to ISO 8601 with UTC time zone.
  comment: This signal is supposed to be set whenever a new trip starts.
           A new trip is considered to start when engine gets enabled (e.g. LowVoltageSystemState in ON or START mode).
           A trip is considered to end when engine is no longer enabled.
           The default value indicates that the vehicle never has been started, or that latest start time is unknown.

TripDuration:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: s
  description: Duration of latest trip.
  comment: This signal is not assumed to be continuously updated, but instead set to 0 when a trip starts
           and set to the actual duration of the trip when a trip ends.
           A new trip is considered to start when engine gets enabled (e.g. LowVoltageSystemState in ON or START mode).
           A trip is considered to end when engine is no longer enabled.

TripMeterReading:
  datatype: float
  type: actuator
  unit: km
  description: Trip meter reading.
  comment: The trip meter is an odometer that can be manually reset by the driver

IsBrokenDown:
  datatype: boolean
  type: sensor
  description: Vehicle breakdown or any similar event causing vehicle to stop on the road,
               that might pose a risk to other road users.
               True = Vehicle broken down on the road, due to e.g. engine problems, flat tire, out of gas, brake problems.
               False = Vehicle not broken down.
  comment: Actual criteria and method used to decide if a vehicle is broken down is implementation specific.

IsMoving:
  datatype: boolean
  type: sensor
  description: Indicates whether the vehicle is stationary or moving.

AverageSpeed:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: km/h
  description: Average speed for the current trip.
  comment: A new trip is considered to start when engine gets enabled (e.g. LowVoltageSystemState in ON or START mode).
           A trip is considered to end when engine is no longer enabled.
           The signal may however keep the value of the last trip until a new trip is started.
           Calculation of average speed may exclude periods when the vehicle for example is not moving or transmission is in neutral.
