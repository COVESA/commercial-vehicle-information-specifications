* Flatbed trailer: This trailer type has an open flat bed cargo unit.
* Box trailer: This trailer type has a cargo unit that is covered by walls and a roof.
* Tanker trailer: This trailer type has a cargo unit that is specicialized for carrying liquid cargos.
* Freezer trailer: This trailer type has a cargo unit that is specicialized for carrying cargos that require cooling.
* Specialized trailer: This trailer type has a cargo unit that does not match with any of the other types...
