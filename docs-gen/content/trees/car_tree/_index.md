# The Car tree
The Car tree is identical to the [VSS tree](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/tree/master/spec), version 5.0.
The vspecPreprocessor can be configured to modify it by e. g. changing the seat layout to a ragged matrix with 2 and 3 seats in the two rows,
but it can also configure it to be an exact copy of the standard VSS tree.
