# The truck tree
The vspec truck tree is a super tree that contains signal definitions for a large set of different truck models.
The HIM configurator is then used to create a signal tee for a specific truck variant.

The different variants that are present in the vspec files are:
* Tow truck: This truck type does not have an integrated cargo unit, but instead it is temporarily connected to a trailer (which defines its own signal tree).
* Flatbed truck: This truck type has an open flat bed cargo unit that is integrated with the rest of the truck.
* Box truck: This truck type has a cargo unit that is covered by walls and a roof that is integrated with the rest of the truck.
* Pickup truck: The model would support pickup trucks to be defined here also...
* Van: The model would support vans to be defined here also...
